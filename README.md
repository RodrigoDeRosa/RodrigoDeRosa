## Hey, there! I'm Rodri De Rosa 🦀

A music-loving, football-addicted and martial-arts-enthusiast Software Engineer on a quest to satisfy his curiosity about nearly everything.

Hope you find what you're looking for in my [repositories](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa?tab=repositories)! If you don't, do reach out
and I'll try to help as soon as I can. In the meantime, you might be curious about the same stuff I am, so you can snoop around
[my blog](https://www.rodrigoderosa.com) (hey! it's a work in progress).

Although I like to say I'm a Software Engineer (not backend developer and most certainly not a Java or a Python developer), the coincidences
of life have put me on the backend path of the industry and that's what I've been doing for a while; first in the e-commerce industry back
in Buenos Aires, later in the digital groceries (and warehouse automation) business when first moving to Amsterdam, then through
the finance world, followed by renewable energy — helping build the awesome [Dexter Energy](https://dexterenergy.ai/) — and now at Uber,
working on systems that operate at a slightly ridiculous scale.

Along this way I've worked mostly with Java and Python, building everything from services used thousands of times a second, to systems
that control robots in warehouses, to nice-looking financial graphs, to heavy-duty data processing for ML systems — and now wrestling
with the kind of problems that come up when you're trying to handle all the addresses and places in the world.
