## Hey, there! I'm Rodri De Rosa ðŸ¦€

A music-loving, football-addicted and boxing-enthusiast Software Engineer on a quest to satisfy his curiosity about nearly everything.

Hope you find what you're looking for in my [repositories](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa?tab=repositories)! If you don't, do reach out
and I'll try to help as soon as I can. In the meantime, you might be curious about the same stuff I am, so you can snoop around
[my blog](https://www.rodrigoderosa.com) (hey! it's a work in progress).

Although I like to say I'm a Software Engineer (not backend developer and most certainly not a Java or a Python developer), the coincidences
of life have put me on the backend path of the industry and that's what I've been doing for a while; first in the e-commerce industry back
in Buenos Aires, later in the digital groceries (and warehouse automation) business when first moving to Amsterdam, then throguh
the finance business, and now in the renewable energy business, in which I'm trying to help build the awesome [Dexter Energy]([https://secfi.com/](https://dexterenergy.ai/)). Along this way I've worked mostly with Java
and Python, building from services used by thousands a second, through systems that simply control a robot in a warehouse to some nice looking
financial graphs and heavy data processing for ML systems.
